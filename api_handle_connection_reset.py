'''
This code defines a get_data function that takes in url and headers as inputs and makes a GET request to the specified URL. It uses try-except block to catch any request exception that might be thrown, it then checks if the exception is an instance of requests.exceptions.ConnectionError and in this case it prints an error message that it's retrying in 5 seconds, waits for 5 seconds and re-tries again.

This way if the function encounters a "Connection reset" error, it will pause for 5 seconds before retrying the request. This delay can be adjusted based on your use case or requirements.

As before also, this is just one way of handling pagination and the specific implementation may vary depending on the API you're working with, and the way they've implemented the pagination itself. Please refer to the API's documentation for information on pagination and the specific structure of the pagination links and also handling errors.
